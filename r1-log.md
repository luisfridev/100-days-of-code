# 100 Days Of Code - Log - @luisfridev

### Day 001: January 6, 2026

**Today's Progress**: Check of the PHP basics: variables, conditions, data types.

**Thoughts:** I think it's good to have a quick refresher on PHP, and in this course, Héctor de León explains things very well and to the point.
Personally, I sometimes found ternary validation a bit confusing, but now it's much clearer..
